    <td>LDRs and the robot arm.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Make a working LDR and maybe get onto coding the robot arm.                                                                                                                                          </td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we nearly made the robot arm pick up a glue stick.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered when our robot arm didn't move at all.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned how the LDR actually worked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was independent when coding the LDR.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on what went well and what we could do with the robot arm next time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged when setting up the robot arm and LDR.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think what couldâ€™ve gone better is if I understood the LDRs more I could of expanded my knowledge a bit more but apart from that and maybe set up the FUZE box quicker - to maximise our learning chances - we did really well and got onto the robot arm that nearly picked up a glue stick.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think next time when working on the robot arm we need to improve by maybe doing something more creative like drawing a picture with it or just try to make it more interesting than trying to pick up a glue stick.</td>
